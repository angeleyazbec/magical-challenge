                <br>
                Marinated steak and corn. 
                Red pepper, snap peas, mushroom, and hot pepper spice, 
                with a side of baby carrots.

                <br>
                Princess Armelle absolutely loved her meal! Chef Jose was
                very creative with marinating her steak and adding some
                zingy spices to her vegetables, which added exquisite flavor
                to Princess Armelle's meal. 
                Her family simply could not feed her fast enough.
                She cleared all of her dishes and was even reaching into
                her empty dishes in the hopes of enjoying an additional
                bite. Chef Jose really set the bar with this meal. All 
                other chefs will have to rise to the challenge.

                Princess Armelle would like to give an honorable mention
                to the Sous Chef at Teppan Edo who prepared her dinner.
                She enjoyed her food and finished it all. As always, the
                show by the hibachi-trained chef was amusing and 
                entertaining to her and her family.

                    She was very hungry prior to her meal being served and devoured
                    every bite once it arrived. Chef Jeremy was extremely kind and 
                    prepared a delectable meal fit for the Princess. He even 
                    created a special presentation plate that brought a smile
                    to Princess Armelle's face. Chef Jeremy also went above
                    and beyond in his service to the Princess by making her extra 
                    sweet potatoes to enjoy the next day. Chef Jeremy rose to
                    the challenge and went above and beyond in his service.

                accommodate her dietary needs. While Princess Armelle 
                could not enjoy a crepe, the chef prepared her a unique
                crepe filling of her own. A blend of chicken, apples, pears,
                and peaches was the perfect meal to serve to the Princess.
                She enjoyed her refreshing meal and gives her compliments

                to Princess Armelle's needs and double checked which
                vegetables she could have prior to preparing her meal.
                Her meal was served at the perfect temperature and there
                were no leftovers to be found. Chef Jorge ensured this 
                competition is going to be tough with an out of this world

                to serving. This meal was so delicious that the Princess pouted 
                when her dish was taken away for her second helping. Chef
                Al was very kind, extremely detail-oriented, and most deserving
                of Princess Armelle's high honours. Other chefs are going to
                have a hard time meeting the high quality service of Chef Al.
