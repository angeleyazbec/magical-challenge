                <br>
                <br>
                Princess Armelle of the Kingdom of Light
                has come for her Annual Royal Tour of Walt Disney World Resort in 
                Florida. Every year since she was a baby, Princess Armelle
                has visited Disney World. She enjoys the
                whole magical experience: the rides, the shows, the music,
                the fireworks, the lights on her chariot, and the food, most of all. 
                There is hardly anything she enjoys more than eating a 
                particularly magical meal that satisfies her voracious appetite 
                and makes her feel like the royal princess she is. A close second 
                would be the lights her royal chariot, which are exquistely and 
                expertly designed by her royal Mechatronics Engineer.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is not easy, however, to please Princess Armelle when it comes
                to her food. While she is a princess of few words, she will let you 
                know how much she likes, or dislikes, her food. To please Princess Armelle,
                the food must be pureed to a perfect consistency with the right
                complementary blend of proteins, potatoes, vegetables, and spices
                that she simply cannot resist. Also, just like every other princess,
                do not let her size fool you: she can eat her weight in food. Thus, 
                an adequate portion size is also very important to Princess Armelle.
                She simply cannot leave from a meal hungry and dissatisfied with how
                her food was prepared.

                <h3>Therefore, Princess Armelle's royal family has challenged the chefs
                at Walt Disney World Resort to create the most magical meal for Princess 
                Armelle. Each dinner and dessert will be judged by the following categories:
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>

                Temperature

                Of course, it is not enough to simply create an amazing dinner and dessert
                for Princess Armelle, but the chef himself or herself must also provide a 
                magical experience for the princess. Therefore, the chefs themselves will
                also be rated on the following categories:
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                 Kindness
                 <br>
                 Accommodating
                 <br>
                 Attentiveness to Needs
                 <br>
                 Timeliness
                </ul>
