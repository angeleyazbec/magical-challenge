                <br>
                Princess Armelle's personal
                Walt Disney World Master Royal Chef Competition 2023 is here! 
                <br>
                <br>
                Princess Armelle of the Kingdom of Magical Lights
                has come for her Annual Royal Tour of Walt Disney World Resort in 
                Florida. Every year since she was a baby, Princess Armelle
                has visited Disney World. She enjoys the
                whole magical experience: the rides, the shows, the music,
                the fireworks, the lights on her chariot, and the food, most of all. 
                There is hardly anything she enjoys more than eating a 
                particularly magical meal that satisfies her voracious appetite 
                and makes her feel like the royal princess she is. A close second 
                would be the lights her royal chariot, which are exquisitely and 
                expertly designed by her royal Mechatronics Engineer.
                <br>
                <br>
                It is not easy, however, to please Princess Armelle when it comes
                to her food. While she is a princess of few words, she will let you 
                know how much she likes, or dislikes, her food. To please Princess Armelle,
                the food must be pureed to a perfect consistency with the right
                complementary blend of meat, potatoes, vegetables, and spices
                that she simply cannot resist. Also, just like every other princess,
                do not let her size fool you: she can eat her weight in food. Thus, 
                an adequate portion size is also very important to Princess Armelle.
                She simply cannot leave from a meal hungry and dissatisfied with how
                her food was prepared.
                <br>
                <br>

                <h3>Each main course and dessert will be judged by the following categories:

                Of course, it is not enough to simply create a magical main course 
                and dessert for Princess Armelle, but the chef himself or herself 
                must also provide a magical experience for the princess. 
                Therefore, the chefs will
                also be rated on the following categories:
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                 Understanding of Needs
                 <br>
                 Accommodating
                 <br>
                 Desire to Please
                 <br>

                    The restaurants of Princess Armelle's 2023 Annual Royal Tour

                    Each main course and dessert will have its review
